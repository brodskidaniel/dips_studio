            <h3>System Development</h3>
            <p>
                We design and implement scalable software systems built for long-term use,
                experimentation, and technical stability. Our focus is on clear structure,
                reliability, and adaptability across evolving project requirements.

            <h3>Games & Simulations</h3>
            <p>
                We create interactive environments, mechanics, and simulations that prioritize
                responsiveness, coherence, and a sense of presence. Each experience is developed
                with careful attention to behavior, systems, and user interaction.

            <h3>Creative Technology</h3>
            <p>
                We explore and develop creative technologies that combine structured engineering
                with experimental thinking. This includes tools, systems, and technical solutions
                that support both innovation and production-quality execution.

    <p class="about-text reveal">
        DIPS operates as a focused digital studio built on intention, discipline, and creative
        curiosity. We value clear communication, mutual respect, and shared responsibility for
        the quality of what we create.
        <br><br>
        Our work is collaborative by design. Ideas are explored openly, challenged thoughtfully,
        and refined through discussion, testing, and iteration. Decisions are made with long-term
        impact in mind, not short-term convenience.
        <br><br>
        We prioritize sustainable progress. Skills, systems, and workflows are developed carefully
        over time, allowing space for learning without sacrificing structure or professionalism.
        <br><br>
        DIPS is built to last — as a studio, a creative environment, and a place where thoughtful
        digital work is produced with consistency and care.

    <h2 class="reveal">Work With DIPS</h2>

    <p class="form-intro reveal">
        DIPS is built for people who enjoy creating with purpose. We are looking for thoughtful,
        curious, and creative individuals who want to be part of a focused studio environment
        where ideas are taken seriously and craftsmanship matters.
        <br><br>
        What matters most is not experience or titles, but mindset. A willingness to learn,
        communicate openly, and take responsibility for your work is valued more than any
        specific skill level.
        <br><br>
        Working with DIPS means contributing to projects from an early stage, having real
        influence on how things are built, and growing alongside the studio as it evolves.
        If you are motivated by quality, collaboration, and the satisfaction of building
        something meaningful together, DIPS offers a place to do exactly that.
