            <h3>Games & Simulations</h3>
            <p>
                We create interactive environments, mechanics, and simulations that prioritize
                responsiveness, coherence, and a sense of presence. Each experience is developed
                with careful attention to behavior, systems, and user interaction.

    <h2>About DIPS</h2>

    <div class="text-block">
        <p>
            DIPS is an independent digital production studio focused on thoughtful creation,
            technical craftsmanship, and collaborative work. The studio is driven by curiosity,
            structured problem-solving, and a shared respect for both creative and technical disciplines.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our work begins with a genuine interest in building meaningful digital experiences together.
            Rather than prioritizing short-term outcomes, we emphasize learning, experimentation,
            and long-term quality.
        </p>

        <p>
            At DIPS, collaboration is grounded in respect, clear communication, and creative integrity.
            These values guide how we work, how we grow, and how we approach every project we develop.

    <h2>Work With DIPS</h2>

    <div class="text-block">
        <p>
            DIPS is built for people who enjoy creating with purpose. We are looking for thoughtful,
            curious, and creative individuals who want to be part of a focused studio environment
            where ideas are taken seriously and craftsmanship matters.
        </p>

        <p>
            What matters most is not experience or titles, but mindset. A willingness to learn,
            communicate openly, and take responsibility for your work is valued more than any
            specific skill level.
        </p>

        <p>
            Working with DIPS means contributing to projects from an early stage, having real
            influence on how things are built, and growing alongside the studio as it evolves.
