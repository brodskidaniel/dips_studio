  <h2>How We Work Together</h2>

  <p class="workflow-intro">
    DIPS grows slowly and intentionally.  
    We focus on trust, communication and long-term teamwork.
  </p>

  <div class="timeline">

    <div class="step">
      <span class="step-number">01</span>
      <h3>Getting Along & Learning Together</h3>
      <p>
        We start by getting to know each other.
        Learning how to communicate, cooperate and work smoothly without friction.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <span class="step-number">02</span>
      <h3>Finding the Team Flow</h3>
      <p>
        We build rhythm and respect.
        Everyone works at their own pace, solo or in small groups.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <span class="step-number">03</span>
      <h3>Slow & Passive Growth</h3>
      <p>
        When projects start earning, we move carefully.
        No rush. No pressure. Only sustainable progress.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
      <span class="step-number">04</span>
      <h3>First Released Games</h3>
      <p>
        We release games and evaluate naturally.
        Promotion is optional — decisions are data-driven and calm.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="step highlight">
      <span class="step-number">05</span>
      <h3>The Main Project Begins</h3>
      <p>
        Once aligned and experienced, we begin our large flagship project —
        built on everything we’ve learned together.

  <div class="workflow-note">
